Sync [Prairielearn](https://prairielearn.org/) code boxes to the cloud, live!

If working on a Prarielearn group assignment, this extension will allow all group members to edit the text in realtime.

If working alone, this will sync your code so it isn't accidentally lost.

**Note**: This extension has only been tested on Google Chrome but seems to work perfectly fine in Firefox too.

**Note**: Live syncing will only occur between users of this extension.
